# Air-Canvas
This project is about how to build a air canvas using opencv library in python.In this we will create a python application where we can draw and paint and write in open space.So what we shall do here is: define the color of our marker to use as a pencil and by moving it, we can draw in space. Hence it is just a painting application with the exception that the canvas is air in this case.
Here, we shall input live video feed and capture the movement of our marker. Before that, we define the marker by its color.  Then, to track it, we shall use the concept of ‘contours’ in OpenCV.
